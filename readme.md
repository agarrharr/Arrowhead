# Arrowhead (name not finalized)

Currently the app lets you pick a directory. When you tap on the directory, it shows you all of the files and folders in that directory.

| Locations | Files |
| --------- | ----- |

## TODO

- [ ] Instead of showing a list of files and folders, show a list of lines from those files that start with 0 or more whitespace characters and then "- [ ]", "- [x]", or "- [X]".
