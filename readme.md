# Arrowhead (name not finalized)

Currently the app lets you pick a directory. When you tap on the directory, it shows you all of the files and folders in that directory.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix bug - The first time you pick a directory and tap on it, it shows a blank page. The console shows an error that says you don't have access
- [ ] Instead of showing a list of files and folders, show a list of lines from those files that start with 0 or more whitespace characters and then "- [ ]", "- [x]", or "- [X]".
